# What is Sims Unity?
Sims Unity will be an open source recreation of the Sims 1 in the Unity engine.

## How is this different to FreeSO/Simitone?
This project utilizes the Unity game engine instead of MonoGame/XNA and also will only support The Sims 1 and not The Sims Online.
This project may utilize code from FreeSO where appropriate with full credits given.
